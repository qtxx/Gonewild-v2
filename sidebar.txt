Gonewild is a place for open-minded **Adult Redditors** to exchange their nude bodies for karma; showing it off in a comfortable environment without pressure.

**The nudity here is 100% free! Don't advertise here (or use us elsewhere), ask/offer money, votes, or anything else** (well, comments and love are okay, you get the idea).

**Be cautious of any unusual private messages containing a link offering to share "private" photos with you from unknown, new or unverified users.**

**DID SOMEONE FIND YOUR FACEBOOK? It's a joke/trick link. Don't give them more contact info. Report/block them!**

## Rules
- **Read the FAQ before commenting or posting**. This sidebar is the TL;DR, but you're still obligated to follow the guidelines and the general spirit of the FAQ.

- **Report any comments or threads you find abusive**. We check the reported queue often. If you come across a user being mean spirited or posting personal info, click the report link. When you argue with a troll, you are entering a competition to see who has more free time. You will lose, because you have a life and the troll does not. **Do not EVER respond to trolls. Instead, report them!**

- **Be respectful**. Don't insult the ones brave enough to submit photos / videos. If you don't want to see dicks then don't open the ones with the [male] tag... it'll likely be dicks.

- Don't make creepy, threatening, or malicious comments. Don't be an asshole or crash our party with your drama. **Respect the anonymity of our users or be banned**. If you link to another user's personal info / content outside reddit--if you so much as try to guess a name--you will be shown the door.

- The Reddit spam filter sometimes mistakenly nabs perfectly genuine non-spam posts. If you think a submission of yours or someone else has been filtered, please contact the moderators.

- **March Update: gender tagging titles is optional**. [f] (female), [m] (male), [cd] (cross dresser), [t] (transexual), or simply a [?] are still admissible, but pls don't mis-tag.

**If you use reddit to sell panties, fetish items, cam shows, or anything similar, and wish to post to Gonewild, please do so under a separate account**. We wish to remain separated from all money-making endeavors, so that Gonewild remains a purely exhibitionists subreddit where people post for absolutely no other reason than the thrill of it.

We want to foster safe, mature, low-pressure environment for true exhibitionists that are out for nothing other than to show off their naked bodies. **We don't explicitly state everything that is and is not allowed, so please don't try to skirt the rules**. Thank you!

For dating, 1-on-1, soulmates, friends, and hook-ups please go to /r/r4r.
